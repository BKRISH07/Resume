## üíº Work Experience

### **Software Engineer | Indiana University**  
*Jan 2025 ‚Äì Jul 2025*  
- Designed and deployed Azure-based computer vision pipeline in Python, integrating SLEAP, YOLO, and Keypoint MoSeq to track multi-animal behavior and object interactions in rodent studies.  
- Integrated Azure OpenAI with LangChain to engineer an autonomous analysis agent that extracts behavioral metrics (e.g., thigmotaxis) and generates structured summaries by correlating CV outputs with scientific literature via RAG.  
- Developed an interactive query agent enabling researchers to ask natural language questions about experimental results and receive context-aware insights based on precomputed analysis.  
- Scaled the pipeline on Azure to process 200+ hours of video, reducing manual review time by 60% and improving reproducibility through automated documentation and insight generation.  

### **Software Engineer Intern | PrimaThink Technologies Pvt. Ltd**  
*Jun 2022 ‚Äì Dec 2022*  
- Engineered a video upload pipeline using AWS S3 pre-signed URLs with React and TypeScript, enabling 50+ educators to upload content with 15% faster processing.  
- Automated multi-device streaming via AWS Lambda‚Äìtriggered MediaConvert (FFmpeg) HLS transcoding, reducing playback buffering and eliminating format compatibility issues by 27%.  
- Dockerized Node.js analytics backend with DynamoDB and Elasticsearch to record video playback events and generate educator-facing insights, processing 5,000+ daily engagement logs.  
- Implemented CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins to automate testing (Jest), Docker image builds, and deployment of video processing and analytics services.  

### **Frontend Developer Intern | SkrapNest**  
*Jan 2021 ‚Äì May 2021*  
- Constructed a dashboard using React.js to visualize real-time scrap pricing trends and user activity, leveraging Django REST API with scheduled polling for live updates.  
- Refined real-time pricing API by implementing PostgreSQL indexing and Redis caching, reducing query response times at peak traffic by 43% and enabling instant dashboard updates.  
- Boosted user engagement by 5% through implementing price drop alerts using Simple Email Service.

## üìÇ Projects

### **RentalMentor** | *Next.js, FastAPI, OpenAI, LangChain, MongoDB, WebSocket*  
- Developed an AI-powered rental advisory chatbot enabling users to seek rental guidance, neighborhood insights, and lease-agreement explanations through a persona-driven interface.  
- Integrated LangChain with OpenAI APIs for intelligent query handling, document summarization, and personalized advice. Implemented WebSocket for real-time chat, reducing average response time from 3.2s to 1.8s.  

### **WriteSync** | *React.js, Node.js, gRPC, WebSocket*  
- Built a real-time collaborative text editor supporting up to 100 concurrent editing sessions with sub-50ms sync latency using gRPC streaming.  
- Enabled multi-user editing with WebSocket-based live collaboration and minimal latency, incorporating lightweight user presence tracking.  

### **Secure Banking System (SBS)** | *React.js, Express.js, Node.js, Tailwind, Material-UI*  
- Developed a FinTech platform for credit, withdrawal, and transfer transactions featuring role-specific dashboards.  
- Secured the platform with an NGINX reverse proxy, MFA, JWT authentication, and RBAC to mitigate fraudulent transactions.
